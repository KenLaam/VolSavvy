This document outlines our policy regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information for users of the app.

## Information Collection and Use

We do **not** collect, store, or share any personal information through the VolSavvy app. Any data you enter is processed locally on your device.

We may engage third-party providers to:

- Support or operate parts of the service
- Perform service-related tasks
- Analyze how the app is used

These providers are only allowed to access information necessary to perform their tasks and are bound by confidentiality agreements.

## Security

We are committed to protecting your information. While we use commercially acceptable methods to safeguard it, no system can guarantee absolute security.

VolSavvy may include links to external sites. We do not control and are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of third-party websites.

## Children’s Privacy

VolSavvy is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If we learn that a child under 13 has submitted personal data, we will promptly delete it. If you're a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the app, please contact us.
